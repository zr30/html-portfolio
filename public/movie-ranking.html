<h1>The Best Movies According to Zach</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once
</h3>
<p>This film was as a gorgeous as it was evocative. It effortlessly covered themes spanning from the struggles of mother daughter relationships, the challenges of immigrants, existentialism, what it means to grow up in a maximalist world made possible by the internet and social media. I felt heard in some regards but mostly was just in awe.</p>
<h3>Into the Wild</h3>
<p>There is something so romantic about leaving society behind and returning to nature. Giving up all material possessions for a journey inward and trying to find sense in the world. I resonate with a lot of sentiments of the main character</p>
<h3>Pitch Perfect</h3>
<p> This movie is just so entertaining and always makes me smile</p>
